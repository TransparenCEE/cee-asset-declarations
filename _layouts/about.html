    <p class="text-justify">TransparenCEE is a community of non-profit, IT, and media organizations that use technology for better transparency, accountability, and governance in the Central and Eastern Europe. “Asset Declarations in Central and Eastern Europe: Current Trends” is a project of TransparenCEE undertaken with the aim of contributing to anti-corruption efforts and democratic development in the region, through the assessment of efficiency and functioning of asset disclosure systems in the 18 participating countries. The data and analysis presented on this platform are a result of joint research endeavours of organisations from Albania, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Kosovo, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine. In each country, leading non-governmental organizations working in the field of transparency and accountability of public institutions contributed with providing answers to 35 questions related to the existing rules and systems of asset declarations. The data was collected through a survey conducted in the summer of 2017.</p><br />
