This document is a template for writing laws on asset declaration. The template itself is divided into 9 major areas:
1. Scope of legislation
2. Occasions for submissions of declarations
3. Government agencies responsible for declarations
4. Form and minimum content of declarations
5. Verification, investigation and explanation of declarations
6. Access to and use of declarations
7. Sanctions or consequences for non compliance
8. Databases
9. Awareness building mechanisms
The template itself doesn’t help with writing the exact provisions, but rather gives an overview of how a law should look like. Downside is that it doesn’t go into detail. It could be helpful if we ourselves want to do the drafting.
The most useful part is the part No. 4. Form and minimum content of declarations since it goes into a little more detail than the rest of the document.
