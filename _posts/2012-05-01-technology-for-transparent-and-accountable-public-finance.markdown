The report was first published in 2012. by Open Knowledge Foundation. It focuses on projects that are using technology to imrpve fiscal transparency of their countries. There are three types of projects who do the following: 
- Looking at where the money comes from
- Monitoring where the money goes
- Projects which focus on 'invisible money' (state or semi-state owned enterprizes etc.)
The report also examines 4 data portals from different countries (UK, Canada, Republic of Corea and Brazil). It also features CSO feedback on data portals, which is probably the most useful for us in terms of for what kind of data formats should we advocate for when it comes to asset declarations.
The problem with this report, when it comes to asset declarations is that id deals with budget transparency, so there is not a lot for us to take out from it, other than the technological aspects of publishing the data.
