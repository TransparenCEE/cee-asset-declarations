In this resource we can find details about seven Asian countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan,
Kyrgyz Republic, India, Bangladesh and Nepal). It consists of seven sections:
- Coverage of asset declaration rules (it gives an overview on how the asset declaration isimplemented in each of these countries)
- What should be declared
- Frequency of declaration
- Monitoring and enforcment (includes the responsible agency and verification of asset declarations)
- Sanctions for non-compliance
- Public disclosure policy
- Overview of implementation and challenges
This resource is not that useful for our work, since the challenges faced by these countries are mostly
overcome by CEE or SEE countries.
