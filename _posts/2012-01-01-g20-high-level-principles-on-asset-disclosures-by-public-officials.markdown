This document just states the principles that the G20 countries agreed upon when it comes to asset
disclosure, and they are as follows:
1. Fair
- Disclosure requirements should be set forth clearly for the public official and for the general public and should be an integral component of laws, regulations and/or administrative guidelines, as appropriate, governing the conduct of public officials in order to establish shared expectations for accountability and transparency.
- Disclosure systems should be as comprehensive as necessary to combat corruption but should require only the submission of information reasonably and directly related to the implementation of laws, regulations, and administrative guidelines, as appropriate, governing the conduct of public officials.

2. Transparent
- Disclosed information should be made as widely available as possible, both within the government and to the general public, in order to facilitate accountability while still taking into consideration reasonable concerns for personal and family safety and privacy and for the laws, administrative requirements and traditions of the Economy.
- Information about the overall administration of the disclosure system, including information about disclosure compliance rates and enforcement activities, should be made available to the public, in accordance with applicable law, regulation and/or administrative guidelines.

3. Targeted at senior leaders and those in at-risk positions
- Disclosure should first be required of those in senior leadership positions and then, as capacity permits, of those in positions most influencing public trust or in positions having a greater risk of conflict of interest or potential corruption.

4. Supported with adequate resources
- Disclosure system administrators should have sufficient authority, expertise, independence, and resources to carry out the purpose of the system as designed.

5. Useful
- Disclosed information should be readily available for use in preventing, detecting, investigating, imposing administrative remedies for and/or prosecuting corruption offenses regarding conflicts of interest, illicit enrichment, and/or other forms of corruption.
- Disclosure should be required on a consistent and periodic basis so that the information reflects reasonably current circumstances.

6. Enforcable
- Penalties and/or administrative sanctions for late submission of, failure to submit, and submitting false information on a required disclosure report should be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.
