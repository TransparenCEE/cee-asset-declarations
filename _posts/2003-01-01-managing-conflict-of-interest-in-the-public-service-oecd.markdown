OECD guidelines are as follows:
Provide a practical framework of reference for reviewing existing policy solutions and
modernising mechanisms in line with good practices in OECD countries.
Promote a public service culture in which conflicts of interest are properly identified and
resolved or managed, in an appropriately transparent and timely way, without unduly
inhibiting the effectiveness and efficiency of the public organisations concerned.
Support partnerships between the public sector and the business and nonprofit sectors, in
accordance with clear public standards defining the parties’ responsibilities for integrity.
In its first part, this report explains the OECD guidelines in detail, and this document should be a
starting point for anyone who deals with asset declaration. This is also the most important part of
this report.
The second part is a comparative analysis of OECD countries' approach to conflict of interest. This
part can be interesting to read, but since the report was published years' ago, the usefulness of these
comparisons now is debatable. The same goes for the case studies in part three of the report.
